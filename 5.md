# Functions

## Why we need to write functions?
Let's first consider about a question: There are several points in an X-Y axis plane, and we know the coordinate of each point. 
Now we need to find the minimum distance between two points among all the points.

### The Core idea of Functions:
-To divide a large programming task into several small tasks by functions, so that the program process is more structured.

-Code reuse: The statement block that needs to repeat the execution can be encapsulated as a function, multiple calls.

-Encapsulation code, function library users do not need to know the internal implementation details of the function, 
only need to know the function call method.

```C++
double dist(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2)
{
    return sqrt((double)(x1 - x2) * (x1 - x2) + (double)(y1 - y2)*(double)(y1 - y2));
}

int mx[], my[]; //Store X and Y coordinates of each point separately
int x,y;
int min=2147483647; //Record the current shortest distance
for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
    for(int j=i+1; j<n; j++){
        int dis = dist(mx[i],my[i],mx[j],my[j]);
        if(min > dis){
            x=i,y=j;
            min=dis;
        }
    }
}
cout<<x<<' '<<y<<endl;
```

## Function Declaration

```C++
    double           dist          (int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2)
//return type   function's name            parameter list 
```

return type: decide what kind of value your function will return
for example:

```C++
int average(int a, int b, int c) //return integer
double dist(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) //return floating number
bool judge() //return boolean value
void work() //special type: have no return value
```

function's name:  just like a variable's name

parameter list: a comma-separated list of variable declarations. It decide the number of parameters that will be received when 
we call this function, which also means the parameters are initialized by the function call.

## Function Calling
To understand the `return` better, let's see the function calling.

A function is a kind of expression.
Like '+', function is an operator defined by the programmer.
And as the operator, its value is "answer" the called function comes up with when it is executed with the parameters.

```C++
double average(int a, int b, int c)
{
    return (a+b+c)/3.0;
}

int main()
{
    cin>>a>>b>>c;
    cout<<average(a,b,c)<<endl;
    return 0;
}
```
