# What is a condition? And what is a statement?

## Statement

A statement is a command given to the computer that instructs the computer to
take a specific action, such as display to the screen, or collect input. A
computer program is made up of a series of statements. 

For example:
```C++
int i; // a variable declaration
int b = 100; // a variable declaration and definition
func_name(); // a function call

/* a compound statement */
if (1 > 0) {
    std::cout << "Reality check" << std::endl;
}
```

All statements in C/C++ must end with a semicolon, or be placed inside a pair
of curly braces (`{}`), otherwise a syntax error is raised.

## Condition

- Is my hair black?
- Am I a person?

The translations from above to C/C++ are:

```C++
is_my_hair_black = my_hair.color_name == "black";
am_i_a_person = typeof(me) == Person;
```

The answers to those `conditions` are either `true` or `false` a.k.a `boolean`.

The key idea of conditions is true/false. Much of the logical stuff within a computer program
is based on boolean operations. In fact, you can implement ALL computer technology in this world
using ONLY boolean operations (proved by mathematicians, not me).

```
<expression1> == <expression2> // is <expression1> equal to <expression2>?
<expression1> != <expression2> // is <expression1> not equal to <expression2>?
<expression1> <  <expression2> // is <expression1> less than <expression2>?
<expression1> <= <expression2> // is <expression1> less than or equal to <expression2>?
<expression1> >  <expression2> // is <expression1> greater than <expression2>?
<expression1> >= <expression2> // is <expression1> greater than or equal to <expression2>?
```

However, comparations are not the all you can do. You can "invert" a boolean value:

```
!<expression> // if <expression> is true, the result is false, vice versa
```

and you do logical operations:

```
<expression1> && <expression2> // is <expression1> AND <expression2> are both true?
<expression1> || <expression2> // is there at least one of <expression1> and <expression2> true?
```

The operations above are the bedrock of our programs, make sure to familiarize yourself with them.

# if/else

Technically the examples above are not `statements`. To make them meaningful for computers, you gotta add more.
Here `if` and `else` keywords come into place. They tell computers to behave differently based on the input that
is fed in.

Take a look at this example:
```C
// x, y and z are all variables with type int
if (x == 3) {
    y = z + 1;
} else {
    z = x - 2;
    x = x + 1;
}
```

#### Explanation

`if` x is equal to `3`, assign the value of `z + 1` to `y`, otherwise, assign
the value of `x - 2` to `z` and the value of `x + 1` to `x` itself.

NOTE that the `else` part is optional, but it always useful if you want to do some "otherwise" stuff.
