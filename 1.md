## Resources For This Course

All course-related resources are on a [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/tjysdsg/technical-artisans-cpp-course).

You can download it via [link](https://github.com/tjysdsg/technical-artisans-cpp-course/archive/master.zip), however, when an update comes up, you won't see it in your local files.

When we later talk about `git`, your are gonna clone this repository and use `git pull` to receive any updates. For now, you can just download the resources you need.

If interested in starting to learn `git` in advance, check out this [tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials) and its official [documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial).

## Environment Setup

For C++ programming environment, we are gonna use [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) by JetBrains. Feel free to use other IDEs that you are familiar with.

Your Duke email account can provide free license for CLion which is extremely helpful. Login using your <NetID>@duke.edu email address, and download CLion via [JetBrains License](https://account.jetbrains.com/students)

After installation, all tools for C++ development should be installed, if not, feel free to ask for help.

## Starter Project

For convenience, I have provided a simple [starter-project](starter-project) for you.

To use it, do the following:

1. Duplicate the whole directory, so that you can use it next time you wanna create a new project.
2. Open up CLion, if it has opened a previous project before, it probably is gonna automatically open it. In this case, use `File -> Close Project` to close the previous project.
3. Click `New CMake Project from Sources`
4. Navigate to the location of `starter-project` and click `OK`
